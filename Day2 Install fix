To fix the module issue,

Step 1,
If there are multiple versions of python installed on your machine uninstall all of them. Microsoft Store python 
conflicts with Python.org's version. (type apps in search bar and uninstall it through that)

Step 2,
Remove the PATHS if they are still there.

Step 3,
download the latest python version from Python.org

Step 4, 
python -m pip install Django

Step 5,
create your project
